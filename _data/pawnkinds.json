Due to a mistake made by one of the employees, the Anties have been set free from the lab and ended up in space.\n\nTheir personalities are gentle by nature, but they were made to know only but war. On each planet they end up, they burn everything down to ash, using themselves as the main source of the fuel.\n\nAnty is hermaphrodite, has no externally exposed reproductive organs, but has both a scrotum and ovaries in the abdomen.\n\nAnty's gender is indicated based on her reproductive system, which was a little more developed prior to consuming the Nutritional jelly.\n\nThe average height of common anty ergates and queen ants is 140cm, while soldier ants are 170cm. Depending on needs or the type of hive, it can transform or grow up to 200cm.",
